# secureApp

The app name is Secure.
This app generates a password using AES Encryption.
The password can be 8-24 characters long, depending upon the users choice.
The user needs to give a key and a password in order to generate the secure password.
The password generated get automatically to the clipboard so that the user can use it.
Also, as of now it doesn't store any values, so the password once generated is safe with the user.
